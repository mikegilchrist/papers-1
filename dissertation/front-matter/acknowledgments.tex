\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I am grateful for the many people at the University of Tennessee and in Knoxville that that made my time here such a pleasure.
First and foremost I want to thank my Adviser, Dr. Michael Gilchrist for his long lasting patience, his availability and his teachings;
always sharpening my focus and providing a new angle to a problem.
Great thanks also goes to my committee Dr. Benjamin Fitzpatrick, Dr. Brian O'Meara, and Dr. Russel Zaretzki as they were always available for questions and discussions and for their great guidance.
In particular Brian O'Meara who always had an open door and tolerated my frequent visits.
None of the work presented in this dissertation would have been possible without their great guidance.
For many great discussions and never a dull momment in the office I also have to thank my labmate Alex Cope.
I also have to thank the faculty and students in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, allowing me to broaden my knowledge and insights with always stimulating discussions and for moral support.
Specially John Reese, Cassie Dresser, Liam Muller, Athmanathan Senthilnathan, Harmony Yomai, and Jim Fordyce.
Thanks also goes to my former roommate Cassie Watters without whom my stay in Knoxville would have been a lot less exciting.
